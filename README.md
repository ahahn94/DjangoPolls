This project shows the results of working through the Django polls tutorial.  
I did some clean code style refactorings and added some more unit tests to improve test coverage, just to get a better
impression of how a good quality django project may look like.

You can find the tutorial [here.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/)
